### The Principles in a Nutshell

As we have covered the need and purpose of personal knowledge management and elaborated on the key concepts and fundamental principles, we can derive a checklist and memory aid to support us in part two of this series.

#### Why Knowledge Management?

- Converging physical, digital, and biological worlds
- Exponential change challenges linear thinking
- Legacy institutions struggle to adapt to exponential age; growing gap in society's ability to keep up
- The transition to the exponential age affects work: job hopping, automation, globalization, skills gap
- Need for lifelong learning and personal knowledge capture systems to thrive in disruptive times
- Knowledge workers spend a great deal of their time - an average of 40% - looking for information and discretionary activities that offer little personal satisfaction.

#### Externalise and Write

- To have a clear and focused mind, we need to externalise our thoughts out of our heads and into our external memory system.
- Writing is, without question, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Write it down if you want to learn something in the long run.

#### Purpose and Mindsets

- PKM: long journey of personal growth, mindset shift, and rethinking relationship with information
- Start with a clear purpose and goals for using a PKM system
- No one-size-fits-all methods; systems must be tailored to individual needs
- Keep things simple; avoid tool overload and focus on habit change
- Good workflows provide structure, trust, and flow, enabling control and focus
- Implement tools or techniques based on fit with preferred workflow and simplicity
- Being organised is a habit - a repeated set of actions you take as you encounter, work with and put your information to use.

#### System Design Principles

- Balance structure and flexibility in PKM system design
- Level 1: Top-Down vs Bottom-Up approaches to organisation of knowledge
- Level 2: Augment Your Brain with tools that mimic cognitive processes
- Libraries vs Forests: Graph databases resemble brain function and better suit PKM tools
- Level 3: Standardise the capture of knowledge objects to streamline workflow and reduce cognitive load
- Your purpose influences your workflow and required objects, types, and tags

In part two of this series, I will apply these principles to determine my intended use cases and workflow and, finally, choose tools and techniques supporting my use cases. We are shifting our focus from why we need personal knowledge management towards how we can implement it into our daily lives.

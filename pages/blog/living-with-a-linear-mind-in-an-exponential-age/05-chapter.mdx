### The Principles in a Nutshell

As we have covered the need and purpose of personal knowledge management and elaborated on the key concepts and fundamental principles, we can derive a checklist and memory aid to support us in part two of this series.

#### The Needs

- In the exponential age, our ability to capture, organise and retrieve our ideas and apply and transfer them effectively from project to project and company to company has become more critical than ever.
- Knowledge workers spend a great deal of their time - an average of 40% - looking for information and discretionary activities that offer little personal satisfaction.
- To have a clear and focused mind, we need to externalise our thoughts out of our heads and into our external memory system.
- Writing is, without question, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Write it down if you want to learn something in the long run.

#### Purpose and Mindsets

- At its core, Personal Knowledge Management is about rethinking your relationship with information and cultivating self-awareness and self-knowledge.
- Decide your preferred workflow before choosing the tools and techniques.
- Tools and techniques should ideally be embedded into a standardised workflow to prevent falling back into old habits.
- A good workflow that works for you is one that provides structure and enables trust and a flow state.
- A Personal Knowledge Management system can serve many different functions and capabilities, so you should always start with why you need or want to use it in the first place.
- Your system can look chaotic to others, but it is right for you if it brings you value and delight. Don't let productivity experts tell you otherwise.
- Being organised is a habit - a repeated set of actions you take as you encounter, work with and put your information to use.

#### System Design

- Organise knowledge by balancing structure and flexibility. Structure is important to keep your system manageable, but flexibility is important to keep it dynamic and responsive to change.
- Apply a bottom-up approach to keep organisation fluid and dynamic. Start with the objects you want to capture and organise and then work your way up to the higher levels of your system.
- Augment your brain by choosing an application that uses a knowledge graph database and reduce cognitive load by standardising how and in which format you capture object types.
- Organise your knowledge organically and according to your interests by tagging or assigning keywords to your objects.

In part two of this series, I will apply these principles to determine my intended use cases and workflow and, finally, choose tools and techniques supporting my use cases. We are shifting our focus from why we need personal knowledge management towards how we can implement it into our daily lives.

### Busyness, the Enemy of Knowledge Workers

How often have you tried to remember something important after a busy day and felt it slip through your mental grasp? This question might seem familiar to you if you are a knowledge worker. Nowadays, knowledge workers experience an endless onslaught of demands on their time where their innate curiosity and imagination wither away under the weight of obligations. We are surrounded by knowledge yet starving for wisdom.

> You might call the mantra of the modern knowledge worker: "I'm so busy"
>
> <cite>-- Mantra of Knowledge Workers</cite>

Research indicates that knowledge workers spend a great deal of their time - **_an average of 40%_** - looking for information and discretionary activities that offer little personal satisfaction. As a result, we instinctively devote time to tedious, non-value-added activities that make us feel busy and thus important (_productive procrastination_). At the same time, organisations constantly strive to do more with less and pile on as many responsibilities as knowledge workers are willing to accept. As a result, many workers report historic levels of stress, distraction, and hours logged, resulting in a global trend called [The Great Resignation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation).

In its essence, no matter what our formal role title is, knowledge work is about coming up with new ideas, solving novel problems and communicating effectively. Information is a fundamental building block in this inherently creative process. Besides, anything you want to accomplish in your personal and professional life requires you to efficiently turn your thoughts, ideas and discoveries into helpful knowledge. Yet, in today's digital age, where information is more accessible than ever, we are paralysed with indecision on where to focus our attention. We consume the equivalent of 174 entire newspapers daily, five times higher than in 1986. 

Thus, the ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. Time and attention are your most scarce and precious resources as a knowledge worker.

### Why We Need to Think Outside our Brain

Our brains have limited capabilities, we can hold a maximum of seven things in our heads simultaneously (Miller, 1956), and our brain is a machine for *jumping to conclusions* (Kahneman, 2013). And a device designed for jumping to conclusions differs from the machine you want to rely on regarding facts, logic and rationality.

To have a clear and focused mind, we need to externalise our thoughts out of our head and into our external memory, which allows us to forget them. It sounds paradoxical, but forgetting facilitates long-term learning. Forgetting is necessary: without a comprehensive filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings.

> <cite>-- The Importance of Writing</cite>

Almost all experts agree nowadays that real thinking requires some form of externalisation, especially writing. Writing is, without question, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Write it down if you want to learn something in the long run. If you're going to understand something, you must translate it into your own words (externalise your ideas).

### Why Most Attempts at Productivity Fail

Information overload heavily taxes our mental resources and leaves us constantly anxious that we will forget something. Busyness *is* a real problem, slowly seeping into leisure time. I noticed it firsthand in my daily life and former role as a Product Owner. I was increasingly overwhelmed with a constant flood of information coming from all directions. Like most people, I tried to apply all the well-known productivity hacks, frameworks and tools. However, it was a reasonably unsuccessful attempt as I could not create and get critical work done efficiently. *So why do attempts to improve your productivity most often not work?*

That is because, in general, good intentions only last for a short time, and only using willpower to achieve something is never enough as it is a limited resource that depletes quickly and does not improve significantly in the long term. On the other hand, not _'having willpower'_ but _'not having to use willpower'_ indicates that you set yourself up for success. But this is no easy feat because the more we are used to doing something in a particular way, the more in control we feel about it, even though we are often less in control of it *(mere-exposure effect)*. Besides, it is difficult to change behaviour in times of stress: the more pressure we feel, the more we tend to stick to our old routines, even when these routines cause problems and tension in the first place *(tunnel effect)*.

So if your tools and work are not embedded into a standardised workflow, you will resist change and sooner or later fall back into old habits due to the abovementioned effects. _But what do we need to achieve lasting and sustainable chances?_

### Purpose and Personal Growth

In general, while diving into personal knowledge management, you should prepare for a long journey of personal growth where you slowly shift your mindset from scarcity to abundance, from obligation to service and from consuming to creating. Ironically, it is not just about accumulating knowledge but about becoming a different person with another way of thinking through constantly questioning one's thinking routines in light of new experiences and learned facts. At its core, it is about rethinking your relationship with information and cultivating self-awareness and self-knowledge.

As a PKM system can serve many different functions and capabilities - _as a knowledge base, a productivity engine, a main idea generator or a learning and dialogue partner_ - you should always start with **_why_** you need or want to use it in the first place. By keeping the end in mind, you stay focused on your goals and are motivated to take the necessary steps to reach them. Don't fall into the trap of the so-called productivity experts promising you quick results and golden mountains. Just like dieting, a good application of knowledge management requires habit change, deliberate practice and perseverance.

Besides, as every person lives in different environments and works and operates under other circumstances, no one-size-fits-all methods exist. Your system can look chaotic to others, but it is right for you if it brings you value and delight. Ultimately, the system has to serve you rather than the other way around.

### Good Solutions are Simple

Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They instead assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means. As a result, most people collect and embrace various learning and note-taking techniques and tools, each promising us to make something more manageable or efficient, but combined have the opposite effect. As nothing really fits together, working *within* this arrangement becomes complicated, and most fail to accomplish anything meaningful or become more productive.

Often, the best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and follow a few basic principles. Only when your work is part of an overarching and interlocked workflow, where all bottlenecks and distractions are removed, can significant change take place. Even the best tool will only improve your productivity considerably if you change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, just as the fastest car will only help when you have the proper roads to drive it on. Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which is thinking.

### Good Solutions provide Structure

A good workflow that **_works for you_** should provide structure, enabling trust and flow. Having structure relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything; if you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head. Instead, you can completely immerse yourself in what's essential, creating a _flow state_ which, in turn, can quickly become a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, making it more likely for us to enjoy the work.

It is not just about feeling in control; it is about setting up your workflow so that you _are_ in control. And the more options you have to steer your work towards what you consider interesting and relevant, the less willpower you have to put into getting things done. This not only allows us to stay focused for longer but also to have more fun. Ultimately, if work becomes rewarding, the dynamic of motivation and reward becomes self-sustainable.

So the next time you want to implement a new shiny tool or technique, take a step back and decide based on how it will fit inside your preferred workflow. Ask yourself: does it really make something more straightforward, or is it just another distraction or bottleneck?

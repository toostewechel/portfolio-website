### A Growing Divide

[Raoul Pal](https://app.capacities.io/789f7b14-1e17-43f4-adfa-3635d606c49d/a82651eb-5406-4fdc-bb12-151da302876e) describes the 2020s as *"The Exponential Age"*: an era that is characterised by a range of new technologies that are converging the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting all disciplines, economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be human ([Singularity](https://app.capacities.io/789f7b14-1e17-43f4-adfa-3635d606c49d/d30bc384-c0d2-4b9d-8b56-6d4bb00c6681)). 

Simply put, it refers to the notion that things are changing faster and faster, also known as exponential change. And that concept is challenging to grasp as our brains think very linearly. A perfect illustration of this cognitive limitation was that policymakers didn't fathom Covid's exponential growth during the pandemic. Our brain looks for patterns based on what we know and understand and is near us in a small timeframe. So we add items up when we should be multiplying them instead.

Like our mind, most legacy institutions, social norms, policies and organisations are not designed for the exponential age. They often need to catch up to adapt. As a result, there is an ever-growing gap between the increased pace of change and our society's ability to keep up. This transition from the industrial age to the exponential age also dramatically influences the nature of our work: an increase in job hopping, the unbundling, automation and globalisation of jobs and a growing skills gap in the global workforce. We can now expect to spend only a few months to a few years with one organisation.

### Thriving in Disruptive Times

To thrive in disruptive times, we need entirely new models and learning systems that last throughout our lives. Instead of a single *'timebox*' of education at the beginning of our lives, we likely need a model of continuous self-education, also known as _lifelong learning_ (Gary Bolles, 2017). Thus, our ability to capture, organise and retrieve our ideas and apply and transfer them effectively from project to project and company to company has become more critical than ever. To facilitate this process, I believe every person needs _some sort of personal knowledge capture system_ that can adapt to our changing needs, as it is meant to serve a lifetime of learning and growth. Not having such a system means you are not fully leveraging what you learn. You are not collecting your ideas and making valuable connections between them.

You may think this sounds abstract and think, why do I need this, and where do I start? The good news is that it doesn't have to be complicated. Keep doing what you would anyway: read, think, and write. However, take structured notes along the way and save them through a standardised workflow that fits your needs. This article will first cover the need and purpose of personal knowledge management and elaborate on the key concepts and fundamental principles for efficiently turning your thoughts, ideas and discoveries into a structured treasure of intelligent and interconnected knowledge.

In the second part of his series, you can read along with how I will apply these principles to set up my workflow and personal knowledge management (PKM) system in [Capacities.](https://capacities.io/)

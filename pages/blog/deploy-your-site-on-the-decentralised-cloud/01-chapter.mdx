### The Importance of Cloud Computing

The hype around Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow rapidly. ChatGPT, which recently secured funding from Microsoft, has gained over 100 million users in record time, making it the fastest growing consumer application in history. This surge in demand has caused an exponential increase in the need for cloud computing. Despite the fact that cloud computing utilises multiple servers, a few major tech companies such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have a stronghold on our digital lives, comprising 67% of the global cloud market. This leaves most of society's data in the hands of only three owners.

Today, cloud computing is everywhere. In its simplest form, cloud computing allows you to access services on the internet instead of on your local machine. Overall, cloud computing has become an essential tool for companies of all sizes and industries, enabling them to be more efficient, flexible, and competitive in today's fast-paced digital economy. However, despite the rapid growth, still 30% of server capacity sits idle in many data centers around the world.

To tackle today's inefficiency's and centralisation of cloud computing, there is a small but growing movement towards decentralised cloud computing. Instead of relying on a few large companies to provide cloud services, anyone can contribute their unused computing resources to the network and earn rewards in return. Decentralized cloud computing aims to create a more democratic and secure system, where users have greater control over their data and privacy.

### The Akash Marketplace

One of those decentralised infrastructure providers is Akash Network, an open-source, blockchain-powered platform with a distributed peer-to-peer cloud marketplace that connects users seeking cloud services to infrastructure providers with excess computing resources. A few key characteristics of the marketplace are:

- **Kubernetes Powered** - Akash leverages Kubernetes, the industry-leading container orchestration system, to ensure the secure and reliable hosting of applications. Its robustness has been verified through extensive testing, providing peace of mind for users.
- **Censorship Resistance and Unstoppable -** Deploying application is open to anyone and is secure and censorship-proof. Nobody can stop you from using Akash to build and deploy apps or websites.
- **Pseudonymous -** The protocol is designed to protect your identity, providing a high level of privacy and security. You can use it to deploy applications anonymously, without anyone knowing who you are
- **Peer-to-Peer and Private -** You and the provider you use for deployment communicate directly, without any third-parties. This ensures your data remains secure and private, and nobody can take a cut of your payments or monitor activity. Additionally, Akash's decentralized structure makes it reliable and resilient to single points of failure.
- **Reverse Auction Model -** Users can name their price and specify the necessary resources for their deployed containers. Cloud providers, ranging from individuals to data centers, can then bid to host these deployments when they have underutilised computing resources. This process is similar to how Airbnb hosts can rent out their extra space.

Together, these characteristics make deploying containers roughly [10 times cheaper](https://deploy.cloudmos.io/price-compare) than on any of the big three cloud providers.

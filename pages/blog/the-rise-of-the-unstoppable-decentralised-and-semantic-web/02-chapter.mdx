### The Value of Decentralisation

It is essential to recognise that centralisation in and of itself is not a negative development. Many positive benefits in terms of usability, efficiency and performance can come from consolidating resources and managing economies of scale. However, these perks come at a cost. What we might win in terms of convenience and efficiency, we then lose in terms of control and freedom. However, as we move more and more of our lives from the physical to the digital world, the risks posed by centralised platforms increase significantly.

In the centralised web, information is usually stored in a single location (e.g. server). In our applications, we **point** to this location and tell our device to find and retrieve things such as our Twitter or Instagram posts. This architectural design property eventually led to the monopolisation that has followed in the past decade because whoever controls the location controls access to the information. Ultimately, this results in power asymmetries where large platforms often dictate who can participate in certain services under the pressure of regulations. Clunky terms of service or abuse of platform guidelines can, in the worst case, lead to the loss of all information and intellectual property individuals store on such platforms.

Decentralisation focuses on structural interventions that might realign power relationships between institutions (governments, corporates) and their end users. Properly designed decentralised systems strive to avoid any chokepoint where a single actor can constrain the use of the system while preserving as much of the usability properties of centralised systems. Important properties and concepts of distributed systems are:

- **Censorship resistance** - Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information. In decentralised systems, users can publish and discover content directly to distributed storage systems without the need for intermediaries that can potentially censor information.
- **Data portability and interoperability** - Decentralised systems use open-source protocols and data standards to address the issue of data portability and interoperability. These properties enable greater competition and user choice by lowering the barrier to entry for new platforms. Users can seamlessly switch between different services without losing all their **locked-in** proprietary data as they do in current centralised platforms.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks** - A P2P network is a distributed networking architecture that divides tasks or workloads across several computer systems (nodes), removing a **single point of failure**. P2P networks are highly resistant to attacks and, thus, more secure and scalable.
- **Trust-less transparency networks** - Blockchains are immutable, which means that once they record data on-chain, it becomes permanent and unalterable. Blockchains bring unprecedented trust and transparency to their users and provide complete data integrity and a verifiable, shared source of the truth.
- **Ownership of data** - To ensure data safety, (transactional) data is often cryptographically encrypted and stored on a (public) distributed blockchain ledger. The owner of the **private key** has complete access control (CRUD) and can always verify the integrity of its data.
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** - SSI is a novel approach to digital identity that allows users to self-manage their digital identities without depending on third-party providers to store and centrally manage their data.

Most applications might still look and feel like a toy today. Still, suppose developers combine these properties and concepts in the right way. In that case, it can significantly enhance the everyday experience of the web, creating, for example, a genuinely password-less web, privacy-preserving distributed machine learning tasks or a **permaweb** of data where documents and applications are stored forever. Moreover, these services can create whole new (digital) economies. Economies where virtually everyone has the chance to become a **prosumer** - people who simultaneously consume and produce - and where they trade their goods in peer-to-peer markets or share them for free without rent extracting intermediaries.

However, the decentralised web is still in its infancy. As its goals undoubtedly appeal to the tech-savvy and politically inclined users, most users are not ideologically motivated and have no interest in using these, for now, more complex systems in their daily lives. There are still a lot of challenges that need to be solved before the technology crosses **the chasm** into mainstream adoption.

### The Road Ahead

There are still a lot of challenges that need to be solved before decentralised web applications can compete with the centralised **killer apps** that everyone loves and uses today. Firstly, it is technically more challenging to build a decentralised application because not all the data is in one place and developer adoption is still tiny compared to popular frameworks for developing web applications. In addition, developers often need to learn new mental models, programming patterns, and languages. However, many open-source frameworks and software development kits (SDKs) are emerging, enabling developers to iterate and compose (new) solutions quickly.

Secondly, one of the most significant challenges with making decentralised applications usable for average users is security: how do we prevent users from losing access to their data? The mental model of security is entirely different in the decentralised web: you will have one 12 or 24-word long and unrecoverable password phrase (**private key)** known only to you but which you can connect to any decentralised application. However, lose your unique password, and you lose access to everything associated with that private key. Emerging options such as **social recovery wallets** that are both safe and easy to use are still in their infancy.

The third challenge is monetisation and incentives. Since user data is vital for monetising current platforms, there is little incentive to adopt interoperable protocols as platforms would rather own all the data. Popular content generates the most revenue, so platforms are incentivised to prioritise viral, attention-grabbing and feel-good content. Designing robust reward mechanisms and placing curation of content in control of a community are still unsolved problems.

Finally, as no central entity is in charge of the code, governance, regulatory and compliance issues still need to be ironed out. The digital domain requires regulation and control to establish a more legitimate and productive balance of power. These issues raise the question of the best way to conceive and conceptualise such norms and rules. A recent ban of an open source decentralised protocol in the US and the arrest of its developer show that we are still moving very much in uncharted waters. There is still no clear regulatory framework which raises questions from application developers about how they should develop their applications to comply. The regulatory uncertainty discourages innovation and could cause a **brain drain** in the space.

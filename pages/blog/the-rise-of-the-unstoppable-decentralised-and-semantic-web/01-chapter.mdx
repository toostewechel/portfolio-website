### Capitalism Taking Control

Since the web came into existence in 1989, it has steadily evolved into an ecosystem of large, corporate-controlled, centralised mega-platforms often referred to as **“privately owned walled gardens”**. Driven by capitalism, a few big players control the lion’s share of society's assets and extract the most value. A prime example of the stranglehold companies have over our digital lives is the cloud market, where only four companies own 67% of the global market. Yet, in many ways, these mega-platforms are a positive development. They significantly improved usability and enabled billions of people to discover, create and publish content for near *zero marginal cost without* becoming experts on the underlying protocols.

However, the web is increasingly becoming a place for public debate and a battleground for protecting freedom of speech and expression. So when a small number of stakeholders have outsized control over the content the public can create and consume, it becomes a target for censorship at the behest of national governments blocking specific content and excluding **marginalised** communities. As just a few platforms drive the most traffic to news sources, their opaque, unaudited curation algorithms can create bias and filter bubbles, exposing readers to stories that skew toward a readers' preconceived (political) worldview. In light of the Snowden revelations, the Cambridge Analytica scandal and significant data breaches by LinkedIn and Facebook affecting billions of users, the public concerns around spying, polarisation and privacy on the web have grown exponentially over the last decade.

We cannot expect governments, corporations, or large faceless organisations to grant us privacy and control of our data out of their goodwill. The status quo amasses our data for excessive profits and makes it easier for governments to conduct large-scale surveillance of their citizens. We must defend our privacy if we expect to have any. But why is privacy so fundamental to an open society?

### Why Privacy Matters?

One doesn't want the whole world to know a private matter, such as your financial data, location or telephone number. Privacy is the power to reveal oneself to the world selectively. When I purchase a book, there is no need to know who I am or when I send or receive messages; my provider doesn't need to know to whom I am speaking or what others are saying to me. When the underlying mechanism of the transaction reveals my identity, I have no privacy as I cannot selectively reveal myself: I must **always** reveal myself. Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems only to disclose your identity when needed and strong cryptography so that information you share can only be seen by those for whom you intend it.

Privacy is not only an individual right but also a social value, and almost every country recognises privacy as a universal human right. Besides, people have been defending their privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The past technologies did not allow for strong privacy, but today's electronic technologies do.

Proponents of the **decentralised web** want a new and better web that is open, private, secure, reliable and free from censorship. By creating and utilising decentralised infrastructure and tools, they want to distribute control more evenly, protect users' privacy by default and shift ownership of data and society's assets out of the hands of a few corporations back into the hands of users.
